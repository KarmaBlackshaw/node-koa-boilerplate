The **`Listeners`** directory contains the classes that handle your **events**. Event listeners receive an event instance and perform logic in response to the event being fired. For example, a **UserRegistered** event might be handled by a **SendWelcomeEmail** listener

You can make a listener using the following command:

```
npm run make:listener [name]
```
