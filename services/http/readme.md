The `Http` directory contains your handlers and middleware. Almost all of the logic to handle requests entering your application will be placed in this directory.

You can make a handler and store using the following command:

```
npm run make:module [handler_name]
```

You can make a middleware using the following command:

```
npm run make:middleware [middleware_name]
```
